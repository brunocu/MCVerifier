Minecraft [Paper](https://papermc.io/) plugin for discord user verification. Connect to a custom discord bot and sync roles with minecraft permissions for verified users.

I made this for myself out of need and for fun, but feel free to use and pr. Subject to change without notice.

## Requirements

- [Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault) Permissions API.
- A permission plugin that supports groups, I recommend [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/).
